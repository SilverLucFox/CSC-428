our course is divided into 2 parts :
    1 -:- pl-Sql :
            you think you know Sql
                its not a programming language
                    query we use it for to extract data form a database
                        sql contains 2 groups ddl and dml
                        DDL:
                            data definition language
                            create
                        DML:
                            data manipulation language
                            update delete
first part is DML and DDL and some theory:

write a query that returns all attributes that table person contains :
    ||select * from person;

the general format of select is :
    || select //attributes// From //tableName// ;
    where //is a filter that requires  a condition//
    Orderby // the term orderby will sort the records of the dynamic set
the content of the table is static although u can add records
    || select * from persons where person.region equals [r] ;
    //because r isn't in the database it will ask the user to fill the r variable
    // whenever i run it i can get any number of inputs and will get many possible outputs its dynamic
consider person has 3 attributes credit debit and b_name :
write a query that gets the credit and debit and the balance
    ||select person.name,person.debit,person.credit , (credit - debit) as balance from person;
a calculated field should not be in the table we put it in a query

the difference between
                        20/6*6 =   20*6/6
                        3.3*6  =   120/6
                        19.98  =   20
whats the difference between left join right join and inner join


select person.name,region.RName from person innerJoin 
region on person.PRegion = region.id where region.RName = [r]
