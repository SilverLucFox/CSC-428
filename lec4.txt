            the first paragraph is the explanation on table space

oracle implicitly commits the current transaction before and after every DDL Statement
many DDL Statements may cause oracle to recompile or reorganize schemas.
DDL Statements are :
    create : to create a new to table and to create elements
            Example : 
        to create a table , you can give the following Statement<
                create table emp (empno number(5) primary key,
                                    name varchar2(20),
                                    sal number(10,2),
                                    job varchar2(20),
                                    mgr number(5),
                                    hireDate date,
                                    comn number(10,2));
        >now suppose you have emp table now you want to create tax table with the
        following structure and also insert rows of those employees whose salary is above
        5000
        to do this we can first create tax table by defining column names and datatype
        and then use insert into emp select ....
        Statement to insert rows from emp table .like given below
        <
            create table tax (empno number (5),tax number(10,2));
            insert into tax select empno,(sal-5000)*0.40
                                from emp where sal 5000;
        >
        instead of executing the above tow Statements the same result can
        be achieved by giving a single create as
        <
            create table tax as select empno ,(sal-5000)*0.4
                as tax from emp where sal>5000
        >
        you can also use create table as Statement to create copies of tables
        like to create a copy emp table as emp2 you can give the following Statement
        <
        create table emp2 as select * from emp;
        >
        to copy tables without rows i.e. to just copy the structure give the following Statement
        <
        create table emp2 as select * from emp where 1=2;
        >
