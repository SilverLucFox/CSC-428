Think of a database like a library.
A tablespace is like a bookshelf in
that library where you store books (data).
Now, inside the bookshelf (tablespace),
you put different books (tables).
Each book has pages (rows of data).
Why Use Tablespaces?
    1 - Organized Storage
            – Instead of throwing all books on the floor
                (messy storage), you keep them in shelves
                (tablespaces) to stay organized.
    2 - Better Performance
        – If books (data) are in the right
            shelf (tablespace),
            you can find them faster.
    3 - Manage Disk Space
        – Some bookshelves(tablespaces)
            are bigger or smaller.
            You can control where to store more books.
    Real-World Example in a Database
        - A tablespace is made
            up of one or more files on the computer’s hard drive.
Example in SQL (Oracle):
        CREATE TABLESPACE my_shelf
        DATAFILE 'my_shelf.dbf' SIZE 100M;
This means:
        Create a bookshelf (tablespace) named my_shelf
        Put a storage file (‘my_shelf.dbf’) on the computer
        Give it space (100MB) to store data
