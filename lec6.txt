    CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE taxable_emp

    use the ALTER TABLE statement to ALTER the structure of a table

    <
        ALTER TABLE emp add (addr varchar2(20), city varchar2(20)
                            ,pin varchar2(10));
    >
    to modify the datatype and width of a column for example you want to increase the length
        of the column ename from varchar2(20) to varchar2(30) then give the following command.
        <alter table emp modify(ename varchar2(30));>
        to decrease the width of a column can be decreased up to largest value it holds
        <alter table emp modify (ename varchar2(15));>
        the above is possible only if you are using Oracle ver 8i and above
    to Drop columns :
        from Oracle ver 8i you can drop columns it was not possible in previous versions
            <alter table emp drop column(pin,city);>
        remember you cannot drop the column if the table is having only one column.
        if ther column you want to drop is having primary kry constraint on it then you
            have to give cascade constraint clause
            <alter table emp2 drop column (empno) cascade constraints;>
        all related records with this column will be DELETed
        if it was a modify the records related will be modified 
        because we dropped the primary key with cascade we will DELETE all related records

        step 1 : CREATE a temp table with desired columns using subquery
        step 2 : drop the original table
        step 3 : rename the TEMPORARY table to the original table
