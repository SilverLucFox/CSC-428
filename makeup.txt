The ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT clause is specified to allow the automatic migration of
a row to a new partition if an update to a key value is made that would place the
row in a different partition.

The lower boundary of every interval partition is the non-inclusive upper boundary
of the previous range or interval partition.
